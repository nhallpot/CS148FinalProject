                    <p>I created this web-site because I am very passionate about finding the best solutions for corporations. While this web-site is very limited in terms of
                    functionality, it would give a small business the ability to keep track and control their inventory electronically.</p>
                    <p>Given more time, I would have added a counting system to this website as well. This would be useful to a lot of companies as they wouldn't have to handle
                    inventory counts on paper, they would just use the same site that they have been keeping track of their inventory already.</p>
                    <h5>I hope you enjoy the site!</h5>
